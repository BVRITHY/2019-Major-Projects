# Severity-level-Detection-of-diabetic-retinopathy-in-retinal-fundus-images
Researchers have found that non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) was present in 25% of patients 5 years after they were diagnosed with diabetes, 60% at 10 years, and 80% at 15 years. These studies also found that the incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) varied from 2% in those who had diabetes for less than 5 years to 15.5% in those who had diabetes for 15 or more years. While diabetic retinopathy is a common risk all diabetic patients face, technological advancements in the medical field have now made retinal screenings more accessible, which in turn will help to shorten diagnosis timelines and help provide better quality care. Taking precautionary measures to put an end to preventable blindness should be top-of-mind for both providers and patients.The objective of this project is to automate the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy and evaluate the severity with high efficiency, through an overall feasible approach. This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Network Architectures on images from the dataset after being subjected to appropriate image processing techniques like Image Normalization, image augmentation and evaluation process of Diabetic Retinopathy as well as serves as an expert guidance system for practitioners around the world.
